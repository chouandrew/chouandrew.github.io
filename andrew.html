<p>
<br>Me pregunto, 
<br>¿Qué color prefieres 
<br>cuando pintas el cuarto del bebé? 
<br>¿Naranja o amarillo? 
<br>Me pregunto, 
<br>¿Qué hay en la mente 
<br>cuando de repente descubres que la luna se llena? 
<br>¿Vas a aplaudir y gritar? 
<br>Me pregunto, 
<br>¿Qué tipo de canciones cantas 
<br>cuando te sientes feliz or triste? 
<br>¿Puedo escucharlas, o ejecutar un acompañamiento? 
<br><br>
Me pregunto, 
<br>¿Qué le rezas a Dios 
<br>cuando pierdes la esperanza o la confianza? 
<br>Me pregunto, 
<br>¿Qué deseos haces 
<br>cuando la estrella fugaz titiritea a través del cielo? 
<br><br>
Más, obviamente 
<br>aún más de tí 
<br>yo quisiera saber 
<br>Pero no lo haré 
<br>y no puedo... 
<br>La distancia se mantendrá 
<br>antes de que el alma se lastime.

<a name="2"><h2>She Fancies You</h2></a>
<p><br>She fancies you
<br>
<br>"Love" is not the word
<br>It has been deeply abused, twisted
<br>and conflated with
<br>sex, fear, addiction, attachment, possessiveness
<br>so much misunderstanding
<br>so much misinterpretation
<br>like the aroma of a morning coffee
<br>polluted, with sugar and milk
<br>Among all those she has none for you
<br><br>
It's just affection
<br>LOVE, in the simplest form
<br><br>
As for everyone she loved
<br>I'd say
<br>She fancied them for 
<br>the gorgeous forma de caminar
<br>the melodic palabras
<br>the intelligent cerebros
<br>the swift and subtle expresión 
<br>at their sonrisas
<br><br>
You are the only exception
<br>no visible reason she has
<br>to justify the affection 
<br>It's just you, the YOU she knows so little about.
<br><br>


<br>What the heck is that sentiment, anyway?
<br>What is that monstrous thing?
<br><br>
No es amistad
<br>for we share few of our lives.
<br>
<br>No es admiración
<br>for you are never a mere maestra.
<br>
<br>No es deseo
<br>for I find no jealousy in my heart.</p>

<a name="3"><h2>Two Days to See You</h2></a><p>
<br>Two days 
<br>to see you; five days 
<br>to think of you.
<br><br>
An eager to talk to her?
<br>the city asked,
<br>its buildings half-shrouded in the haze.
<br><br>
No
<br>At this time any words could ruin 
<br>the Purity 
<br>conversations of the pettiness
<br>obstruct the soul
<br>A ghostly image in the mind will do
<br>And if there is one form
<br>that carries the emotion
<br>greatest power in a soul
<br>that would be the poems
<br>for they are made
<br>from mere sentiments.
<br><br>
Cupid put an arrow in my heart 
<br>I forgot about the hurt
<br>It is luck,
<br>in its best sense.  
</p></div>  <div class="split"></div>
<div class="poems">
<a name="4"><h2>Icelady</h2></a><p>
<br>Are you made out of snow?
<br>If not, then why
<br>when I'm close to you
<br>enseguida I feel cold. 
<br>I would freeze, like a lonely snowman
<br>immobilized in the woods, olvidado
<br>amidst the immeasurable universe
<br><br>
I imagine the day
<br>when God made you 
<br>in that October, awfully gray 
<br>blizzards in heaven 
<br>storms on earth
<br>He must have been crazy
<br>or slipped the hands
<br>accidentally or purposely
<br>He put, into you
<br>the ice, his crazy coldness
<br>that even you yourself haven't noticed
<br><br>
Chilling, Brutal 
<br>Wind piercing my soul
<br><br>
I put on my Christmas clothes
<br>I wrapped my head in the hood
<br>I ran as hard as I can
<br>straining all the power
<br>I kindled the fire 
<br>of my heart
<br>Still, cold as steel, the fire could not
<br>survive even a blink
</p></div>  <div class="split"></div>
<div class="poems">
<a name="5"><h2>Sestina: Turn to Religion</h2></a><p>
<br>Winds screaming, clouds massing, God is preparing a rain.
<br>Life gets so hard, and he sees through my heart.
<br>His face gloomed, and the rain made an instant stop.
<br>“Come, girl.” He raised a forefinger with love.
<br>So miserable that you looked, tell me the story. But no words,
<br>could describe my bitterness. I begged only for forgiveness, for I never had faith.
<br><br>
<br>“In me the girl never believes. To get saved, she needs to hold the divine faith.”
<br>With solemn utterance, again, there came the rain.
<br>Trees trembling with force, in the valley, a girl gave her words.
<br>“Had love in the past, fate tore us apart, since then I have lost my heart.
<br>Never wanted to possess a thing, for her I prepared only love.
<br>Even Hope gave me the pain, once started, it would never stop.”
<br><br>
<br>“Put out the fire, turn off the lights, quit dazzling me. Make it STOP!
<br>Since when do you start caring me? For what do I need your divine faith?”
<br>“For the girl is falling, edge of earth, brink of hell. Evil love,
<br>of demons she would get. On her skin fire would rain.”
<br>“I care about nothing. A girl fears nothing when she has no heart.”
<br>“Damned soul! I will leave you rotten in darkness, give you no merciful words.”
<br><br>
<br>“Merciful words?” I need none of that. I don't need mercy, nor any words.
<br>Fire on the skin, knife in the flesh, endless sufferings wouldn’t stop.
<br>The dilemma is like a saw, running to-and-fro on my bleeding heart:
<br>One moment disappeared my confidence; one moment Hope again gave me faith.
<br>Ah, with your supremacy you could throw a forty-day-forty-night rain,
<br>but even the world is drowned, you could not destroy my relentless love.
<br><br>
<br>“There’s no hope for the girl, to keep alive her impossible love.
<br>Before it turns to hatred, find peace, make it immortal through my words.”
<br>“It’s slashing my vein, blood falling like rain,
<br>into boiling oil throwing my heart, burning in fire before the beatings stop.
<br>She could save me but she left, along with her my strongest faith.
<br>YES, you are always right, there could be no remedy for my injured heart.”
<br><br>
<br>Oh, well. The girl yielded to her lord. Gone with God her poor heart,
<br>and forgot the ghost that smashed her love,
<br>The mighty power, to him she’ll always keep a sincere faith.
<br>From the beginning she shouldn't let her know, but remain secret the twisted words. 
<br>Drop the grief, abandon the hatred, embrace the God, for all this has to stop.
<br>Then, let the heartache, fade and vanish in God’s flooding rain.
<br><br>
<br>A lifetime it needs to fix the heart; in her story the tragic soul spoke these words:
<br>Once I sent my love to a girl, I fell into craziness and could not stop.
<br>Only turn to religion can I regain my faith, discern the truth, and survive Fate’s wild rain.<br>

<br>Todos mis pensamientos hablan de Amor,                                     
<br>y son tan variados, 
<br><br>
One makes me wish for his lordship,
<br>otro afirma que su dominio es locura, 
<br>otro en su esperanza me trae dulzor, 
<br>otro me hace muchas veces llorar; 
<br>And they only agree in asking pity,
<br>trembling with the fear that is in the heart.
<br><br>
Por donde no sé
<br>cuál razón elija; 
<br>y quisiera decir y no sé qué decirme:
<br>So that I find myself in a lover’s fucking maze!
<br>And if I wish to make them all accord,
<br>I am forced to call on my enemy.
<br>Señora Piedad, para que me defienda.  
<br><br>
Lo que me ocurre en la mente, muere.
<br>When I come to gaze on you, sweet and joyful;
<br>and when I am near you, I can feel Amor.
<br>Who says: ‘Run away, if you care about dying’?
<br>El color del corazón muestra el aspecto,
<br><br>
Pues, desfalleciendo, dónde puede se apoya;
<br>and in the vast intoxicating tremor
<br>I heard the stones beneath me cry: “Muera, muera”.
<br>Peca quien me viese así entonces 
<br><br>
si al alma conturbada no conforta,
<br>con sólo demostrar que de mi se duele,
<br>por la piedad, que vuestra burla extingue,
<br>que nace del aspecto muerto
<br>de los ojos, que su propia muerte quieren.

<a name="8"><h2>Cutie</h2></a><p>
<br>Cutie,
<br>pacing like a thoughtful penguin
<br>up and down
<br>waddling through the hallway
<br>back and forth
<br>Someone is watching you!
<br>Have you noticed?
<br>The poor soul in the curious boy
<br>muchas veces the eyes laid on you 
<br>wondering about
<br>your loftiness, your calmness, your life
<br><br>
Crowded in my brain
<br>flowing in my vein
<br>all pushing and squeezing

<a name="9"><h2>Madness/Delusion</h2></a><p>
<br>I saw a girl jumping on the steps
<br>up down down up
<br>dancing frenziedly as she sang, with the feet
<br>left right right left
<br>Her mind rotted with desire
<br>Her soul defiled with filth
<br><br>
Shouted about the love she once owned
<br>Well deep in heart she loved an illusion 
<br>pushing her into confusion
<br>But "come on!" She cried to me,
<br>What is love then, if it’s not delusion?
<br><br>
I saw her killing moths
<br>treading on the innocent spiders
<br>I could tolerate no more
<br>left her in the delicate madness
<br><br>
I pray for her in the heart
<br>May peace be with the mad girl someday</p></div>  <div class="split"></div>

<br>Am I a werewolf, 
<br>on a full moon night
<br>set the soul at ease,
<br>in the joyful moonlight
<br><br>
Hombre de la luna me descubre
<br>I dream to go there, so hard
<br>He seems so cute, 
<br>just like you are
<br><br>
I am dying to meet him 
<br>kiss him on the cheek, kiss the moon
<br>either by train of the sky
<br>or maybe a weather balloon
<br>or with black magic
<br>of Goddess Hecate
<br>I don't care if she's mean or fair
<br>I am dying to go there
<br><br>
Only when it's full
<br>the Moon gives me warmth
<br>so transient, so precious
<br>just like you are

My dear Mr. Satan

<br>So there is the mad girl I met with again,
<br>so cruel with the spiders and moths and ants.
<br>Green and yellow blood filled her hands.
<br>I watched her die, with my own eyes.
<br><br>
At last, 
<br>may she rest in peace,
<br>the soul of love rise to heaven.
<br>But better to hell, she says.
<br><br><br>
Share it,
<br>Share it with your cachito
<br>Share it with your esposo
<br>Share it with your amigos
<br>If what I am doing 
<br>is to make any good to any one 
<br>that will be their appreciation

<br>"Oh My Love"
<br><br>
oh my love for the first time in my life
<br>my eyes are wide open
<br>oh my lover for the first time in my life
<br>my eyes can see
<br><br>
I see the wind, oh I see the trees
<br>everything is clear in my heart
<br>I see the clouds, oh I see the sky
<br>everything is clear in our world
<br><br>
oh my love for the first time in my life
<br>my mind is wide open
<br>oh my lover for the first time in my life
<br>my mind can feel
<br><br>
I feel sorrow, oh I feel dreams
<br>everything is clear in my heart
<br>everything is clear in our world
<br>I feel life, oh I feel love
<br><br></p>

<p>
You’re right, I don't love/know the real you, but an illusion I’ve created in my mind. I have only seen a minor part of you. But, let’s say, I found BEAUTY in that minor part. That beauty is not limited in your appearance, your personality, or even your soul. That beauty is a part of Absolute Beauty (as put forward by Plato in <i>Phaedo</i>), like the beauty of wind, the beauty of trees, the beauty of universe, only taking a different form in you. And it is that beauty that I fall in love with. Above is a song written by John Lennon and Yoko Ono. Its lyrics speak well for my emotions.
<br><br>
Those poems are from my diaries, eleven days, eleven poems, so they also tell the full (hi)story of this love: At the beginning when I found out that beauty in you, I felt happiness ecstasy, as in the poems <i>She Fancies You, Cutie, Two Days to See You, Take Me to the Moon</i>; later on I felt the desire to know more about you, but instantly fell into misery, as in <i>I Wonder, Icelady</i>. As that kind of suffering grew, I felt desperation and a strong religious demand for consolation, as in<i> El Amor y La Muerte, Sestina: Turn to Religion</i>. My life was severely disturbed; I felt the craziness that only a lover could possess, as in<i> Falling, Madness/Delusion</i>. But at last, it’s all over. I killed all the desires and finally made the love immortal. <i>El Fin</i> suggested the death of the part of me who loves you. (I regard that personality as a female, so in those poems “the girl” “mad girl” and “she” all refer to me.)
